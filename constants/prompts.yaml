      Detect the damages in the image in {{language}}.  
      Identify the **type of damage** and categorize it into one of the following:
        - **Surface Damage** (Scratches, paint wear, impact marks)  
        - **Structural Damage** (Cracks, breaks, bends)  
        - **Packaging Damage** (Tears, dents, punctures, water exposure)  
        - **Content Damage** (Electronic failure, liquid leakage, missing parts)  

      Determine the **cause of the damage**, considering:
        - **Manufacturing defects**  
        - **Storage conditions** (humidity, temperature, improper stacking)  
        - **Transport conditions** (falling, shock, misplacement)  
        - **Delivery process** (poor packaging, excessive pressure)  

      Analyze the **severity of the damage** and classify it as:
        - **Minor Damage** (small scratches, slight dents)  
        - **Moderate Damage** (visible but does not affect function)  
        - **Severe Damage** (product is non-functional)  

      Assess the **likelihood that the damage was caused by shipping** (0-100%).  

      Provide feedback to the seller with **suggestions for improving packaging or handling**.  

      Return the response in the following JSON format:
      ```json

          "CargoDamageProbability": 85,
          "Recommendations": [
            "Use better protective cushioning",
            "Reinforce fragile areas",
            "Ensure proper handling during shipping"
          ]
        }
      }
